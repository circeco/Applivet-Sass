# Applivet.it

This commercial website is made for a construction company based in Milan. The website includes the main page divided into sections and the second page for more descriptive purpose. Both pages contain contact details and a contact form. This version of the website is for educational purposes only so many images and descriptions details might change in the future to fit the customer need. 

## UX

### User Story 

Possible customers and clients can see what are the company activities and work

### Strategy

My goal in the design was to show clearly what the company does and provide different ways to contact the company. Through the different sections of the main page, possible customers and clients can easily understand what the company does and where it operates. One section is also dedicated to direct different type of customers to meet different needs. Contact links are available at any time of the navigation. 

### Scope 

The scope is to showcase the service and the work that the company provide and to give easy access to contact the company in different ways that fit best customers and clients needs. 

### Structure 

The website is divided into two pages, one main page and a secondary page. The main page is divided into sections. The first section wants to summarise services and works that the company provide an emphasis on emergencies/urgent interventions. Scrolling down, there are more details explaining where the company operates. Further down are listed, through pictures and titles, the type of works and services that can be provided. By clicking on the image of work or service, the user would be redirected to the bookmark of the secondary page where the work and service are described in more details. Both pages have a contact form at the bottom and other contact details at the header, which has a fixed position so always available. 

### Skeleton 

The scetch was done with Adobe XD

### Surface 

I have kept at minimum the use of colours with a clear and straightforward approach in the wording also. This was in order to create an effective, informative and functional website that showcases clearly the company while easily connect with possible customers and clients. 

## Technologies 

HTML 

CSS

## Features 
The website uses features for more efficient and effective user experience. CSS @media is used in order to provide a responsive and coherent mobile view that is clear and neat as the desktop view if not better. A JavaScript is been used to design a dropdown menu in many sections that help declutter from excessive wording but giving the option of searcing more information if needed. Contact links are efficiently and directly available and connected to the email, phone number and through the contact form. Hover and pointer are used to indicate to the user that something is clickable and there would be action. It is intuitive and predictable what the action would be. Moreover, the transform propriety is been used to give a dynamic "giant button" effect to pictures which make the site a bit more fun and playful. 
 
### Feature left to implement 

The website is a showcase of the company work so would be continuously updated with the company works and if further services would be provided. Future features could include a more in detail contact form with a selection of selectable options available on a scroll down menu in the contact form. 

## Testing 

The user story achieved the intended outcome of providing them with information about Applivet and way to contact them. In the main page, users can understand what is the company work with many intuitive images of what they do. User has always access to ways of contacting the company and availability to more information also. 

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name/company name', 'email' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit, while the phone number is optional. If all field is valid, the page will reload. 

All links will open in the same tab and to the bookmark created in the description page so that the user will not be sent to a random place of the page but to the exact place of where more info is given about a type of work or service. Links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
